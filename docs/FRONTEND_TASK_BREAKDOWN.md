## Risk Mitigation & Contingency Plans

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Complex animations affecting performance**
   - Mitigation: Progressive enhancement, performance monitoring
   - Fallback: Simplified animations for lower-end devices

2. **Pokemon IP concerns with visual design**
   - Mitigation: Original designs inspired by, not copied from Pokemon
   - Fallback: Generic card game aesthetic

3. **Mobile performance on older devices**
   - Mitigation: Performance budgets, adaptive features
   - Fallback: Graceful degradation for older devices

### Technical Dependencies
- React 18 features (concurrent features, automatic batching)
- Modern CSS features (container queries, CSS Grid)
- Web API availability (Camera, ServiceWorker, etc.)
- Device hardware capabilities (performance, storage)

This comprehensive task breakdown provides the structure needed to deliver a beautiful, Pokemon-inspired Wine Pokédx with professional wine features and native-quality mobile experience. Each task includes clear success criteria and can be tracked independently while maintaining dependencies and overall project cohesion.
